	<h1>My trip to Istanbul</h1>
	<article id="justy">
		At first, my friends and I planned a trip to Montenegro to return home through Istanbul. We had talked about traveling to Montenegro pretty a lot. Everything was packed and ready to move to our destination. All of sudden our plans changed, and I can't remember the reason behind. As you already understood, our target became Istanbul. We stayed there for 9 days, took a flat right in  front of the Bosphorus Strait. The view opened was breathtaking. From our balcony we could see the other parts of Istanbul splitted by the strait, and ferryboats sailing back and forth. We visited almost all the sights, walked tens of kilometers every day, sailed on the ferryboats, took a subway ride right under the Bosphorus Strait, ate a lot of delicious meals, by the way, especially with fish. Istanbul only left an amazing impression, because while I'm writing this article right now, I already crave to repeat my trip there in the very near future.
