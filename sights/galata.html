	<h1>Galata Tower</h1>
	<article id="justy">
		This Genoese tower was built in the 14th century and is one of Istanbul's most recognizable landmarks. It is one of the symbols of Istanbul and it is situated in Galata, on a hill seeing the historical peninsula of Istanbul from A-Z. The origin of the Galata Tower goes back to the fifth century CE, when Byzantines built a wooden tower named Magalos Pyrgos (Great Tower) in order to control the city of Constantinople and Golden Horn. Due to the fires, earthquakes, and the Sack of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusaders in 1204 the wooden tower was completely destroyed. <br />

		In 1348, Genoese community living in the district of Pera (Galata) built today’s Galata Tower and named it Christea Turris (Tower of Christ). Galata Tower is a cylindrical tower made from stone and it is approximately 67 meters long. <br />

		Galata Tower was the tallest building of Istanbul until the construction of Beyazıt Tower in 1749. During the Ottoman period, Galata Tower functioned as jail, observatory house, and watch tower. After the restorations took place in 1960, Galata Tower was commercialized and opened to the public. Today, the tower functions as 360-degree viewing platform of Istanbul. Be aware, though, that it's a super popular sight, so come early or be prepared to wait in line.
